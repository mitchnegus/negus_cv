# CV: Mitchell Negus

My (interactive) CV, designed as printable HTML/CSS.


## Local Server

This hosted version of my CV uses Jekyll deployed on GitHub pages.
To run a local server for testing the site, run the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

This will spin up the server, providing the local address in the output.
